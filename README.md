   <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simulation Environment:</strong> The project comes with a sophisticated simulation environment built using
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides a realistic virtual world for testing and training self-driving algorithms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning Integration:</strong> Leveraging popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow.js
            or Brain.js, the project allows you to build and implement advanced AI models capable of learning and making
            decisions based on the car's sensors and environment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sensor Emulation:</strong> The self-driving car simulation emulates various sensors commonly found in
            autonomous vehicles, including cameras, lidars, radars, and more. These sensors provide crucial input to the
            machine learning models, enabling perception and understanding of the environment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Training and Evaluation:</strong> The repository provides utilities and tools for training and evaluating
            your self-driving algorithms. It offers customizable training procedures, such as reinforcement learning or
            supervised learning, allowing you to fine-tune your models.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Visualization:</strong> To facilitate understanding and debugging, the project includes real-time
            visualization of the car's actions and decisions. This feature allows developers to observe how the self-driving
            algorithm interacts with the simulation environment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Customizability:</strong> The framework is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers to
            experiment with different machine learning algorithms, sensor configurations, and simulation parameters. It
            encourages innovation and empowers you to add new features or modify existing ones.
